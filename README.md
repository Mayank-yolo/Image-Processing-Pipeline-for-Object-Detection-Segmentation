# 🧠 Image Processing Pipeline for Object Detection & Segmentation

An end-to-end **Computer Vision pipeline** built using **YOLOv8** and **OpenCV**, designed for **object detection**, **segmentation**, and **image preprocessing**.  
This project demonstrates how raw image data can be processed, analyzed, and visualized in a modular workflow — ideal for **AI, ML, and data engineering portfolios**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Object Detection** using [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- ✂️ **Object Segmentation** (masking and region extraction)
- 🧹 **Preprocessing Pipeline** (resizing, normalization, etc.)
- 📊 **Visualization Module** for detections and masks
- 🧱 **Modular Code Structure** (clean, reusable components)
- 💾 Works locally — no GPU required (runs on CPU)

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/image_pipeline.git
cd image_pipeline

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)
# or
source venv/bin/activate     # (Linux/Mac)

## 🧠 Usage

### Step 1: Add raw images
Put your images in:
data/raw/

### Step 2: Run the pipeline
python main.py

### Step 3: Check outputs
- Processed images → data/processed/
- Detection results → results/detections/
- Segmentation results → results/reports/
